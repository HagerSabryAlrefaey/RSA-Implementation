# RSA-Implementation
RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission.
You can look for further explanation here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

## Getting Started
- The built-in C type int is only capable of dealing with 16 or 32 bit integers, 
  so you can't perform calculations or encryption algorithms on integers bigger than that
- This project's purpose is to implement RSA algorithm on BigInt data
- Run the project on either the debug on release configuration on VS
- the system will test data from the Complete Test folder and shows you the implementation time in milliseconds.
